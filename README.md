# Coronavirus Models

## COVID-19 Models

At [Produvia](https://produvia.com), our vision is to detect symptomatic cases of the coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, with 99% accuracy. We intend to accomplish this by developing two deep learning models:

1. **COVID-19 Diagnosis **([Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/task/covid-19-detection))
2. **COVID-19 Image Segmentation** ([Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/task/covid-19-image-segmentation))

## COVID-19 Datasets

We intend to use publically-available coronavirus datasets:

1. **COVID-CT** ([Dataset](https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT), [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13865))

   Description: The COVID-CT-Dataset has 275 CT images containing clinical findings of COVID-19.

   License: Non-commercial. Can only be used for research and educational purposes. Commercial use is prohibited.

	}
   ```

2. **COVID-19 Image Data Collection** ([Dataset](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset), [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11597))

   Description: A database of COVID-19 cases with chest X-ray or CT images.

	```

3. **COVIDx** ([Dataset](https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net))

	Description: A dataset with 16,756 chest radiography images across 13,645 patient cases.
