## COVID-19 Models

At [Produvia](https://produvia.com), our vision is to detect symptomatic cases of the coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, with 99% accuracy. We intend to accomplish this by developing two deep learning models:

1. COVID-19 Diagnosis
2. COVID-19 Image Classification

## COVID-19 Datasets

We intend to use publically-available coronavirus datasets:

1. [COVID-CT](https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT)

Description: The COVID-CT-Dataset has 275 CT images containing clinical findings of COVID-19.

License: Non-commercial. Can only be used for research and educational purposes. Commercial use is prohibited.
